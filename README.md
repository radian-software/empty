# empty

Do you often find that the `CHANGELOG.md` and `test` files generated by `lein new default` languish around for months after the start of a project with ugly **FIXME** labels in them? Then `lein new empty` is for you!

## Demo

The `empty` template is simple and to the point:

```
$ lein new empty amazing-project
Generating empty project.
$ tree amazing-project
amazing-project
├── project.clj
└── src
    └── amazing_project
        └── core.clj

2 directories, 2 files
$ cat amazing-project/project.clj
(defproject amazing-project "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "A Clojure project"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.11.1"]]
  :main amazing-project.core)
$ cat amazing-project/src/amazing_project/core.clj
(ns amazing-project.core)
```

## Releasing

Make sure the changelog is up to date and the `project.clj` reflects
the new version number to be released.

To publish a new version of the template to Clojars, run `lein
release`. It will use the configuration in `project.clj` and prompt
interactively for credentials. You must use a deploy token for
authentication.
